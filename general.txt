Daily Load Tracker

This is a program created to track my daily work activities while I delivered car parts for an
automotive supplier.  While probably not the most visually appealing, it is fully
functional.  Also, it filled a need of mine to track my work to ensure I was properlly paid.

A date is required to enter a new load.  Also, new drivers, tractors, trailers, and locations
must be added to the database before they can be used in a load.  This is handled through the 
actions menu item.  

A load can be picked up or delivered to either a customer or a company location.  That is why 
they exist in the same drop down menu but have seperate tables in the database.  

Thanks for taking a look!
