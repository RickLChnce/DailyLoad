# DailyLoad
A Java, Swing, MySQL CRUD application created as a small project that I used to track what I did everyday at a previous job.

I worked at a job moving auto parts between warehouses and docks while attending college.  This provided me with new data daily.  It seemed only natural to create a project that allowed my track my loads of auto parts not only for checking my pay, but for the added programming experience.
